# C Mini Projects

This is a bunch of little C projects which I completed for the course CSCI2122. The course has since been changed and the original assignments have been open-sourced. This repository is all my solutions from back when I took the course.

The course had 10 labs which needed to be completed weekly. Each monday at, a gitlab repo would be added to to my account shared by the lab instructor. I would then need to clone the lab repository onto my account of the Dalhousie server, completed the challenges mentioned in the README file, and then upload my files to the same repository. Gitlab will then run a pipeline for every change that will test and verify my code. When the pipeline passes, I know that my good works correctly.

I've been told that my solutions were very nice. TAs have even mentioned to me that they had used these solutions to check against other students, so I hope these solutions can be a useful reasource for people.
